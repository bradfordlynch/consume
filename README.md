## FAQ

### Why won't you eat anything off the internet?

The internet's a lovely place, filled with content galore. As far as consumption goes, you really couldn't ask for more. 

However, in this specific case, as many reading this may know, it's also deeply distracting, a fact I don't care for. 

For this reason, I reason, I'd rather be brazen, and phase in more paper from which to eat.

With gumption, I stick to my assumption: consumption is better off a physical sheet.
