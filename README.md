# consume
A list of things I'm planning on eating. Recipe recommendations greatly appreciated :)

## FAQ

### Why won't you eat anything off the internet?
The internet's a lovely place, filled with content galore. As far as consumption goes, you really couldn't ask for more.
However, in this specific case, as many reading this may know, it's also deeply distracting, a fact I don't care for.
For this reason, I reason, I'd rather be brazen, and phase in more paper from which to eat.
With gumption, I stick to my assumption: consumption is better off a physical sheet.

### What determines your diet?
I wish to dine on all the food I could.
But limited by time and imbued to full,
I can't eat all I really should.
And so I must choose my fill.

The ones I choose are fine indeed -
but dishes with little frill.
It's these leaner cuts I choose to read.
To feel full, I hope they do fulfill.
